Welcome to the development site of my professional portfolio-website, makerSJÆL.

There is 2 reasons for the existence of this page:
1. The website is for my 1st semester exam
2. For professional use afterwards

If you have any tips, tricks or any other request, hit me up on mail@makersjæl.dk

Best regard Frederik Krath Nielsen
